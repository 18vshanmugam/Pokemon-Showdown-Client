# Pokemon Showdown Log Viewer

This orphan branch contains a basic solution for allowing moderators
of a server to view lobby logs. This is the code that runs
http://logs.psim.us:8080/

We do not intend to offer any support for setting up the log viewer,
as it is primarily intended for use by the main server, and is for
advanced users only.
